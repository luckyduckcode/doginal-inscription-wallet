## 📋 Technical Implementation

### Updated Components:
- `InscriptionCreator.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul with status tracking
- `App.css` - New styles for status indicators and fee controls

### New State Management:
```typescript
interface TransactionStatus {
  step: 'creating' | 'signing' | 'broadcasting' | 'confirmed' | 'error';
  message: string;
  txid?: string;
  blockHeight?: number;
}
```

### Fee Rate Logic:
```typescript
const getFeeRateRecommendation = (feeRate: number) => {
  if (feeRate < 8) return { level: 'low', text: '⚠️ Very Low - May take hours or fail' };
  if (feeRate < 12) return { level: 'medium', text: '⏱️ Medium - May take 30-60 minutes' };
  if (feeRate < 20) return { level: 'recommended', text: '✅ Recommended - 10-30 minutes' };
  return { level: 'high', text: '⚡ Fast - 5-15 minutes' };
};
```

## 🎊 User Experience Flow

1. User enters content
2. Clicks "Create Inscription" 
3. Gets success/error message (no details)
4. No fee guidance (defaulted to very high fee)

### After (New UX):
1. User enters content
2. **Selects appropriate fee level** with clear guidance
3. **Sees live transaction progress** through each step
4. **Gets detailed transaction information** with TXID
5. **Understands confirmation process** and timing
6. **Educated about network behavior** and block explorers
